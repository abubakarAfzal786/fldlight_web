      <strong>Floodlight</strong> aggregates all political contributions
      originating from employees of US-based publicly traded companies and their
      subsidiaries, as well as the political action committees directly
      associated with those firms. The aim is to allow investors to better
      understand how their investment dollars are directly and indirectly
      contributing to political parties and candidates in US Presidential,
      Senate, and House races.
