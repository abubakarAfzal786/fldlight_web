          We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or
          other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags,
          local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to
          automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies
          are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet,
          mobile phone, or other devices that allow us and our partners to
          record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact
          with our Services.
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files placed in
              visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Most
              browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do
              that, the Services may not work properly.

              <strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.</strong>
              A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code
              embedded in the Services that collects information about users’
              engagement on that webpage. The use of a pixel allows us to
              record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page
              or clicked on a particular advertisement.

      <h5>VI. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.</h5>
      <p>
        We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no system is 100%
        secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
        you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we
        do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

      <h5>VII. CHILDREN'S INFORMATION</h5>
      <p>
        The Services are not directed to children under 17 (or other age as

        information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us

        set forth below. If we learn that we have collected any personal
        information in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps
        to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.

        <strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY.</strong><br />
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole
