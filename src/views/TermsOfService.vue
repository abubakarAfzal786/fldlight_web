          RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND FLOODLIGHT THROUGH BINDING,
          INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY

          <strong>Changes to these Terms or the Services.</strong>
          We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If

          Resolution, Individuals” apply to you, the Federal Arbitration Act and
          federal arbitration law. If the terms of Section 14.1 “Dispute
          Resolution, Individuals” apply to you, then except as otherwise
          expressly set forth in Section 14.1 “Dispute Resolution, Individuals,”
          the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you
          and Floodlight are not required to arbitrate will be the state and
          federal courts located in the Los Angeles County, and you and
          Floodlight each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such
          courts.

          <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>
          <div class="sub-section">
            <span class="number">14.1</span> <strong>Individuals.</strong>
            If you are an individual, the terms of this Section 14.1 apply to
            you with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
            or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
            interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services
            (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”):
            <ol class="list">
              <li>
                <u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. We each agree that any
                Dispute will be resolved
                <strong
                  >solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class,
                  representative or consolidated action or proceeding.</strong
                >
                You and Floodlight agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act
                governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and
                that you and Floodlight are each waiving the right to a trial by
                jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration
                provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
              </li>

                <u>Exceptions</u>. As limited exceptions to Section 14.1(a)
                above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims
                court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek
                injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or
                enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual
                property rights.
              </li>

              <li>
                <u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The
                arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
                Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the
                “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
                The AAA Rules are available at
                <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling
                1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must
                submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice
                to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
                provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
                <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.
                <p>
                  Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or
                  parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different
                  location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have
                  exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the
                  interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of
                  this arbitration agreement.

              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration
                and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we
                won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we
                are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your
                Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of
                our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them
                from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to
                an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided
                under applicable law.
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in
                Section 14.1(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues
                of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party
                and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
                the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual
                claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek
                public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has
                the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
                threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
                extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of
                competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
                that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
                be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual

                Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through
                arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's
                claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
                form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
                provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
                this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

                <u>Effect of Changes on Arbitration</u>. Notwithstanding the

                Floodlight changes any of the terms of this Section 14.1
                “Dispute Resolution; Individuals” after the date you most
                recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by
                sending us written notice (including by email to
                <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@floodlightinvest.com"
                  >support@floodlightinvest.com</a
                >) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as
                indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of
                Floodlight’s email to you notifying you of such change. By
                rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate
                any Dispute between you and Floodlight in accordance with the
                terms of this Section 14.1 “Dispute Resolution; Individuals” as
                of the date you most recently accepted these Terms.

              <u>Reservation of Rights</u>. Floodlight and its licensors
              exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the
              Services, including all associated intellectual property rights.
              You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright,
              trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign
              countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any

              notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms constitute the entire and
              exclusive understanding and agreement between Floodlight and you
              regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all
              prior oral or written understandings or agreements between
              Floodlight and you regarding the Services. If any provision of
              these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a
              court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced
              to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of
              these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not
              assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
              without Floodlight’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to
              assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be
              null. Floodlight may freely assign or transfer these Terms without
              restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and
              inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
              permitted assigns.

              <u>Notices</u>. Any notices or other communications provided by
              Floodlight under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii)
              by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of
              receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is
              transmitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Waiver of Rights</u>. Floodlight’s failure to enforce any right
              or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
              such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision
              will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly
              authorized representative of Floodlight. Except as expressly set
              forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
              remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
              remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
